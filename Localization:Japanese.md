E-Mail Integration Issues with Japanese Character Sets
------------------------------------------------------

There are some issues with ISO-2022-JP, UTF-8, and what is displayed in Eventum.

-   2009/04:
    -   This is no longer an issue with Eventum 2.2
    -   If you need E-mail integration to support Japanese, upgrade to Eventum 2.2 -or- later. -Brian LaVallee

-   2008/10:
    -   It looks the the E-Mail integration issue with Japanese mail formats will be fixed in the next release (2.1.2)
    -   The change will 'convert all incoming emails and notes to default charset before storing.'
    -   My testing has verified that it does fix the Japanese character set issues. -Brian LaVallee
