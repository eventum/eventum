<h4>{t}Customize Status Action Date Screen{/t}</h4>
<span>
{t}This page allows you to dynamically configure the values displayed in the "Status Action Date" column in the issue listing screen, for a particular project.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}This column is useful to display the amount of time since the last change in status for each issue. For example, if issue #1234 is set to status 'Closed', you could configure Eventum to display the difference in time between "now" and the date value stored in the closed date field.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}Since the list of statuses available per project is dynamic and database driven, this manual process is needed to associate a status to a date field coming from the database.{/t}
