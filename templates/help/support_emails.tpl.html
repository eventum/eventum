<h4>{t}Associate Emails{/t}</h4>
<span>
{t}This screen allows users with the appropriate permissions to associate emails with existing issues, or create new issues and associate emails with them.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}In order to do that, however, the administrator of the system needs to configure email accounts to make the software download the email messages from the appropriate POP3/IMAP server.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}One of the optimal uses of this feature is to create a separate 'issues' or 'support' POP3/IMAP account and ask your customers or end-users to send support questions, issues or suggestions to that mailbox. Eventum will then download the emails and provide them to the users of the system.{/t}
