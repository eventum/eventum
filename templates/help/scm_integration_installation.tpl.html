<h4>{t}Installation Instructions{/t}</h4>
<span>
{t 1="eventum-cvs-hook" 2="scm"}The %1 script, which is available in the %2 sub-directory in your Eventum installation directory, will need to be installed in your CVSROOT CVS module by following the procedure below:{/t}
<br /><br />
{t 1="CVSROOT"}The first thing to do is to checkout the %1 module from your CVS repository:{/t}
<br /><br />
<b>$ cvs -d %repository_path% checkout CVSROOT</b>
<br /><br />
{t escape=no}The command above will checkout and create the CVSROOT directory that you will need to work with. Next, open the <b>loginfo</b> file and add the following line:{/t}
<br /><br />
{literal}
<b>ALL /usr/bin/php %repository_path%/CVSROOT/eventum-cvs-hook $USER %{sVv}</b>
{/literal}
<br /><br />
{t 1="%repository path%"}Replace %1 by the appropriate absolute path in your CVS server, such as /home/username/repository for instance. Also make sure to put the appropriate path to your PHP binary.{/t}
<br /><br />
{t}You may also turn the parsing of commit messages for just a single CVS module by substituting the 'ALL' in the line above to the appropriate CVS module name, as in:{/t}
<br /><br />
{literal}
<b>%cvs module name% /usr/bin/php %repository_path%/CVSROOT/eventum-cvs-hook $USER %{sVv}</b>
{/literal}
<br /><br />
{t 1="eventum-cvs-hook" 2="CVSROOT"}The last step of this installation process is to login into the CVS server and copy the %1 script into the %2 directory. Make sure you give the appropriate permissions to the script.{/t}
