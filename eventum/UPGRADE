Upgrade Process
===============

We have tried to make upgrading from an earlier release as pain-free as 
possible, and we provide scripts that should bring your current Eventum
installation up-to-date.

- Upgrading from version 1.2 to 1.2.1:
-------------------------------------
No changes necessary.

- Upgrading from version 1.1 to 1.2:
------------------------------------

For the upgrade from release 1.1 to 1.2, there's a set of scripts in the 
following directory that will upgrade your database schema:

  /path-to-eventum/misc/upgrade/v1.1_to_v1.2/

Run the scripts in the following order:

- database_changes.php
- set_support_email_usr_id.php


If you find any problems while upgrading, please email us in the mailing lists
described in the README file.
