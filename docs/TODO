* API cleanups:
 - Support::getEmailInfo() does more than the name says

* Manage Statuses is silly, if you update one status it deletes all entries for
  that prs_sta_id and reinserts everything again except the one you perhaps removed:

UPDATE eventum.eventum_status SET sta_title='discovery', sta_abbreviation='DSC', sta_rank=1, sta_color='#cc9966', sta_is_closed=0 WHERE sta_id=1
SELECT prj_id, prj_title FROM eventum.eventum_project, eventum.eventum_project_status WHERE prj_id=prs_prj_id AND prs_sta_id=1
DELETE FROM eventum.eventum_project_status WHERE prs_sta_id IN (1)
INSERT INTO eventum.eventum_project_status ( prs_sta_id, prs_prj_id) VALUES ( 1, 5)
INSERT INTO eventum.eventum_project_status ( prs_sta_id, prs_prj_id) VALUES ( 1, 4)
INSERT INTO eventum.eventum_project_status ( prs_sta_id, prs_prj_id) VALUES ( 1, 9)
INSERT INTO eventum.eventum_project_status ( prs_sta_id, prs_prj_id) VALUES ( 1, 6)
INSERT INTO eventum.eventum_project_status ( prs_sta_id, prs_prj_id) VALUES ( 1, 7)
UPDATE eventum.eventum_issue SET iss_sta_id=0 WHERE iss_sta_id=1 AND iss_prj_id IN (1)

* Make it possible via workflow to map SCM user to real Eventum user

* Default issue priority is defined in bizarre locations
 - for auto created issues from email, it's a property of email account
 - for issues created from web interface, it is hardcoded to '3'
  -> default value should be property of project

* class.user.php :: getRole : notes:
       // XXX manage/custom_fields.php uses role_id = 9 as "Never Display", which is hack
       return isset($roles[$role_id]) ? $roles[$role_id] : null;

* autocomplete="off"
Add this to forms where you save OTHER USER passwords (admin screens)

* Inline JavaScript must die.
Move them to some common file, better to review code and make similar changes.

* finish other post pages like d0ba4a2
* UI:
** Add new user lookup tool for notification and authorized replier pages
