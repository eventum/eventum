# Notes about creating Eventum Release

## Preparations

The release process assumes certain remotes being setup

This adds `launchpad` named remote and configures it to push only `master` and named tags
```
$ git remote add launchpad git+ssh://glen666@git.launchpad.net/eventum
$ git config --add remote.launchpad.push refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master
$ git config --add remote.launchpad.push refs/tags/v*:refs/tags/v*
```

## Making release tarball

Eventum release tarball is created by Travis-CI for each commit and uploaded to
GitHub when the commit is associated with a tag.

This means that to make release just need to create named tag.

There's also special tag named `snapshot` used to create test tarball before actual release.

```
$ make snapshot
```

# Test before release

- Create PR to update composer dependencies. [example](https://github.com/eventum/eventum/pull/360)
- Make sure [src/Db/Table.php](src/Db/Table.php) lists all created tables in install process (even ones no longer used)
- Create and download snapshot tarball
- Install twice to same database, second time select drop tables, install must not fail
if it fails the error is something like `DB Error: already exists`
- Test the new release directory with a quick installation
  * see if a new issue can be created
  * test if you can upload attacment
  * ...
- update translation keywords to launchpad
  * Run `make pot`
  * Commit eventum.pot and push
  * this should be done day before release so launchpad cron would update .po files.
