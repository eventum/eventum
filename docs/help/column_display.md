# Edit Columns to Display

This page allows you to dynamically control which columns are displayed on
the list issues page.

You can set the minimum role required to view a column. For example, if you
set the minimum role for 'Category' to be 'Manager' anyone with a role lower
than 'Manager' will not be able to see that column. To hide a column from all
users, select 'Never Display'.

Please note that some columns may be hidden even if you specify they should
be shown. For example, if no releases are defined in the system the 'Release'
column will be hidden.
