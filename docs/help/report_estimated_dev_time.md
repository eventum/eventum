# Estimated Development Time Field

This field is used by the reporters of new issues to estimate the total
development time for the issue. It is especially important as a metrics tool to
get a simple estimate of how much time each issue will take from discovery,
going through implementation and testing up until release time.

This field can also be used as a way to check the estimation abilities of
project managers against the impact analysis given by the developers themselves.
That is, the value entered by a project manager here can be compared against the
impact analysis / estimated development time entered by the developers, and this
way get more experience estimating the required time for new projects.
