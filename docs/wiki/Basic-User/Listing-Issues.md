### Listing Issues

All these sections except for "Search Results" can be toggled on/off by a link in the upper right corner of the "Search Results" section. This page reloads at a user configurable interval (See [Editing Preferences](../Basic-User/Editing-Preferences.md)).

## Quick Search

The quick search tool contains fields to allow filtering of issues by parameters such as Assignment, Category, Status etc. You need to enter your search parameters, then click "Search" to apply the filters. At the bottom of the Quick Search tool is a section that links to the Advanced Search page and a dropdown list that allows you to run your saved searches.

## Current Filters

This shows up as a yellow box underneath the Quick Search section. It displays any filters that are currently active.

## Search Results

This section lists all the issues matching your current search parameters. A manager can control which columns are displayed and the number or columns that are displayed by visiting the "Edit Columns to Display" administration page.

## Bulk Update Tool

This tool is available to managers to easily change the Assignment, Status, Priority or Category of multiple issues at once.

## Exporting the issue list

The list of issues under the active filter can be exported as a CSV file and thus to Excel (or any other spreadsheet program capable of reasing CSV). What fields are displayed on the issue list depends on the way the Administrator of the project set up the Fields and columns to display and which minimal user roles are associated with these fields and columns.

If you at any way want to add your own fields to display and thus export, you have the abillity to add custom fields to a project and set these custom fields visible in the issue list of the project.
