Upgrade Process
===============

One of our objectives is to make upgrading from an earlier release as
painless as possible, and we provide scripts that should bring your
existing Eventum installation up-to-date.

Upgrading from version 2.2 and from versions upwards
----------------------------------------------------

 1. Rename your current Eventum dir to `eventum.old`
 2. Extract Eventum release tarball and rename it to `eventum` directory.
 3. Copy all config files from old version to new version: `eventum.old/config` to `eventum/config`
 4. If your workflow API, customer API or custom field files to were in `lib/eventum` copy them to `config/`:
	 - `eventum.old/lib/eventum/workflow/` -> `eventum/config/workflow/`
	 - `eventum.old/lib/eventum/customer/` -> `eventum/config/customer/`
	 - `eventum.old/lib/eventum/custom_field/` -> `eventum/config/custom_field/`
 4. Ensure your database database partition has enough disk space and run upgrade script: `php upgrade/update-database.php`
 5. Modify your workflow/customer classes not to require any Eventum core classes, they are autoloaded now. So you can just remove such lines:

```php
    require_once(APP_INC_PATH."workflow/class.abstract_workflow_backend.php");
    require_once(APP_INC_PATH."customer/class.abstract_customer_backend.php");
```

Upgrading from versions before 2.2
----------------------------------

Upgrading from these versions not supported, you have to go back and upgrade to 2.2 version first.

If you find any problems while upgrading, please email us in the mailing lists
described in the [README.md](../README.md) file.
