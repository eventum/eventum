Upgrade Process
===============

One of our objectives is to make upgrading from an earlier release as
painless as possible, and we provide scripts that should bring your
existing Eventum installation up-to-date.

IMPORTANT:
==========

When upgrading to a new version of Eventum, please follow these
instructions:

- Upgrading from version 2.2 and from versions upwards:
----------------------------------------
1) Move your current copy of Eventum to a new directory.
2) Extract the new Eventum files to a directory.
3) Copy the contents of your old eventum/config/ directory to
   /path-to-eventum/config/
4) Copy your old workflow API and customer API, custom field files to
   /path-to-eventum/lib/eventum/workflow/,
   /path-to-eventum/lib/eventum/customer/ and
   /path-to-eventum/lib/eventum/custom_field/ respectively.
5) Point your webserver to /path-to-eventum/htdocs/
6) Run the upgrade scripts described below from the command line.
   cd /path-to-eventum/upgrade/
   php update-database.php

   NB! when updating databases, review that your database partition has enough disk space.

7) Modify your workflow/customer classes not to require any Eventum core
   classes, they are autoloaded now. So you can just remove following lines:
   require_once(APP_INC_PATH."workflow/class.abstract_workflow_backend.php");
   require_once(APP_INC_PATH."customer/class.abstract_customer_backend.php");

- Upgrading from versions before 2.2:
----------------------------------------

Upgrading from these versions not supported, you have to go back and upgrade to 2.2 version first.

If you find any problems while upgrading, please email us in the mailing lists
described in the README.md file.
